If you are using eclipse (safe assumption) make sure you use the correct name and email when you commit.

When committing, there are two boxes in the middle of the "Commit changes" window. One says "Author" and the other says "Committer".
In most cases, fill these out like this:

    githubUsername <your@email.com>

In my case I would put:

    Author: rpappa <rjp7(at)majorrom.com>
    Committer: rpappa <rjp7(at)majorrom.com>

(Replacing the (at) with the @ symbol)
